# "Newsboy"
A personal news organizer app built using Retrofit, Glide, Room, and dependency injection handled by Dagger+Hilt. Newsboy is a one-stop news search tool that utilizes the NewsAPI service from newsapi.org, offering the ability to receive up-to-date news stories, find stories that suit your interests, and save a collection of stories for the future. Based around the RecyclerView, Newsboy is designed to receive daily updates from NewsAPI using its Room database for storage and organization of API calls.
